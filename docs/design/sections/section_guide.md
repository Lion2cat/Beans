## Design Consistency

Maintain these elements across all sections:

## Reserved Space for Three.js Integration

Each section should consider how Three.js elements might be integrated:

1. **Hero Section:** Background 3D coffee cup or steam animation
2. **Process Section:** Interactive 3D coffee bean that transforms through the process
3. **About Section:** Rotating 3D globe showing coffee origins
4. **Menu Section:** 3D coffee cup that changes appearance based on selection

Leave placeholder comments in the HTML structure to indicate where Three.js elements will be added:

```html
<div class="three-js-container" data-animation-type="coffee-steam">
  <!-- Three.js canvas will be inserted here -->
</div>
```

## Scroll-Triggered Animations

Define animations that occur as the user scrolls through sections:

1. **Fade In:** Elements fade in as they enter the viewport
2. **Slide In:** Content slides in from left/right as it appears
3. **Scale Up:** Elements start small and scale to full size
4. **Reveal:** Text reveals character by character or line by line
5. **Parallax:** Background moves at different rate than foreground

Use the IntersectionObserver API to trigger these animations efficiently.
